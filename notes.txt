Overall idea

If we have a pile of data that have essentially the same mass spectrum then we
should be able to go from raw tof data to a mass calibrated, voltage and bowl 
corrected dataset.  And ideally, to a stoichiometry as well.  This will rely on
hard coding many things on a 'template' dataset, but should make analyzing the 
other datasets much quicker.

Things that need to be pretty straightforward:

read epos files

voltage and bowl correct data

find the 2 paramters (c and t0) that align the data to a template spectrum

find mass spec calibration peaks and refit (c and t0)

find mass spec calibration peaks and linearize the m2q axis

~ Then comes a potentially trickier part... figuring out how to range/count the
ions given a properly bowl, voltage, mass calibrated spectra.  At some point I
may want to chop the dataset up by detector region or applied field (voltage)
and determine composition and so any method for ranging/counting should be able
to work on small (noisy) datasets.

One question may be... once the time independent background is known... do the
remaining background tails significantly affect the stoichiometry... or can
they be totally neglected.
